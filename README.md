# Structures-using-functions
## Description
Structure is user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds. Structures are used to represent a record. You have to use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
### Example:
      struct Books
      {
         char  title[50];
         char  author[50];
         char  subject[100];
         int   book_id;
      } book;
